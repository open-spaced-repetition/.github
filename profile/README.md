## About

Open Spaced Repetition (OSR) is an open-source community dedicated to the advancement of spaced repetition algorithms. We are the creators of the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS), which is backed by academic literatures and experiments. FSRS has been implemented in various programming languages, including Javascript, Golang, Rust, Python, and so on.

## Mission

Our mission is to develop efficient, effective, and accessible spaced repetition algorithms that can be readily integrated into any educational software or system.
